    "## Part 2 - Scale, Standardize, and Normalize\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling, standardization, and normalization all involve the transformation of the values of numeric variables so that the transformed data points have specific helpful properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Scaling</b> involves changing the range of your data, so that it fits within a specific scale, like 0-100 or 0-1. Some ML algorithms, such as support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), or k-means, are based on measures of how far apart data points are (i.e. distances between data points), so a change of \"1\" in any numeric feature is given the same importance. Therefore, variables/attributes with larger value ranges will outweigh variables with smaller ranges and will distort the distance computations for these methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you might be looking at the prices of some products in both EGP and US Dollars. One US Dollar is worth about 17 EGP, but if you don't scale your prices, methods like SVM or KNN will consider a difference in price of 1 EGP as important as a difference of 1 US Dollar! With currency, you can convert between currencies. But what about if you're looking at something like height and weight? Or age and salary? It's not entirely clear how many pounds should equal one inch (or much money equals one year of age). By scaling your variables, you can help compare different variables on equal footing.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Standardization</b>, or z-score normalization, involves changing the range of your data based on the mean and standard deviation. The attribute will have a mean of zero and variance of 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Normalization</b> involves changing the shape of the distribution of your data. You change your observations so that they can be described as a normal distribution. Normalize your data if you're going to use an ML technique that assumes your data is normally distributed, such as linear regression, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), or Gaussian naive Bayes. \n"

    "### Important Notes (taken from Kaggle)\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling your data is a very crucial procedure in most ML algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Scaling is used to make all features contribute the same amount in prediction. Refer to the weight and height, salary and age examples above.\n",
    "    Scaling makes the algorithms converge faster since it transform the variable space in to a much smaller range.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it is time to work on training and test datasets, you must apply scaling separately on train and test sets in order to correctly represent the distribution of the variables in each set. "

The Box-Cox transformation is a formula that has an exponent, lambda `λ`, which varies from -5 to 5. All values of `λ` are considered by the transformation function and the optimal value for your data is selected. The “optimal value” is the one which results in the best approximation of a normal distribution curve. \n",
